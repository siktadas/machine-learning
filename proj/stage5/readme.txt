#### Readme

1. Code base organization:

There is a data cleaning python notebook. 

Each airline has 3 Jupyter notebooks - 
- Moving Average notebook
- Last value notebook
- LSTM notebook - Long Short Term Memory

So in total, there are 10 notebooks.

2. Commands to run code:

The coding file is a python notebook. You will need jupyter installed on your computer to run it. Once you download Jupyter, you can press Shift+Enter to run each block of code.

3. I downloaded data from the https://finance.yahoo.com
I have three datasets -
                1. Southwest Airlines - past 5 years - LUV.csv
                2. United Airlines - past 5 years - UAL.csv
                3. American Airlines - past 5 years - AAL.csv
